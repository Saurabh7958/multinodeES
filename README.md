Steps:

    Create an S3 Bucket:
    Set up an S3 bucket for storing Terraform state files and to keep your certificate as well.

    Update Configuration Files:
        _data.tf: Add tags to describe your VPC and subnets.
        var.tf: Modify the number of nodes or node names as needed.
        main.tf: For a custom password, remove the auto-generated password block and directly set the desired password in var.tf.

    Run Terraform Commands:
        Initialize: terraform init
        Plan: terraform plan
        Apply: terraform apply

Notes:

    Adjust configurations according to your needs.
    The setup ensures high availability and scalability for Elasticsearch.
